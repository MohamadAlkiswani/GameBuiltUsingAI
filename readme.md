# PyGame Game Development with ChatGPT

Welcome to this repository, where you'll find a Python codebase for a PyGame game that was developed with the help of ChatGPT. This project was an exciting journey for me, as I had zero experience with PyGame when I started. But with the guidance and support of ChatGPT, I was able to learn and build this game from scratch.

Throughout the development process, I gave prompts to ChatGPT on each feature that I wanted to implement, and ChatGPT provided me with the code that I needed to make it happen. I made minor changes and bugfixes to the code to make it work for my specific game, and before I knew it, I had a fully functional PyGame game!

From character movement and bullet shooting to collision detection and interactive maps, this game has it all. I'm proud of what I was able to accomplish with the help of ChatGPT, and I hope you enjoy playing the game as much as I enjoyed building it.

Thank you for visiting this repository, and I hope you have a great time playing my PyGame game!
